Oh man, just got out of The Monkey and I'm... kinda lost, like, mentally drunk or something. My back is aching from those seats, you know, like they're made of concrete or something. Seriously, I think they were originally designed by someone who hates humans sitting.

So, the  ... um, a rollercoaster through a jungle of confused dreams??? One minute you're 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this monkey pulling off some insane parkour stunts — and trust me, this monkey outdid every action hero since... ever? — and the next thing, I'm sitting with popcorn crumbs all over my lap and thinking my life is a series of poorly timed jumps. How did the monkey even learn all those moves? It’s like there’s a Matrix but for primates now or something.

> Anyway, the theater was so loud, couldn't hear myself think when those action sequences kicked in. But, the colors, man! They were all over like someone spilled a rainbow and decided, hey, let’s 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 this in slow motion. It’s like a kaleidoscope threw up and I loved it.

There's this scene right in the beginning where everything’s serene and peaceful. The monkey's just chilling there, like it’s meditating or whatever, and boom, outta nowhere, chaos ensues. It reminded me of that one time... wait, did I leave the stove on? 

Someone, I think you, asked if I'd 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again. Maybe? YES. Absolutely. But only if my IQ drops by like, on purpose. 'Cause honestly, it feels like eating an ice cream made of cold fire?

Then, out of nowhere, I’m contemplating life choices just as the monkey stands on a cliff, overlooking a sunrise that feels so real. Except it’s a backdrop so cliché that I almost sneezed irony. And damn it if my chair didn’t squeak every time the plot twisted.

Wish  s had seatbelts sometimes. Also thought — random —but, can monkeys understand their own  s or are they just like us, pretending to get it while munching banana-flavored popcorn? 

Ending was this absurd twist, like, wait, is this monkey actually an allegory? Or am I just projecting because of lack of sleep... 3 hours tops last night.

And oh, who knew I’d leave a theater questioning evolution? Feel like I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Darwin brainstorming.

Okay, enough mental monologues. Was meant to send this ages ago.
